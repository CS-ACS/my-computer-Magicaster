## How I feel about my computer
I absaloutely **love** this thing, I got it in 2019 in december after my old computer, a 2012 macbook, was litterally falling apart. This thing has stuck with me and is an amazing gaming laptop in general. 

This laptop is more powerful than a lot of gaming pc's are, the main problem though is that gaming pc's are big for a reason, to cool themselves down. This laptop having the power of a gaming PC is means it over heats fast.
